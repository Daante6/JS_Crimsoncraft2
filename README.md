# Crimsoncraft2
 My biggest project using Javascript and p5 library

Crimsoncraft2 is a sequel to my first big project, that was made in plain Javascript, where I wrote all the mechanics myself.
It's a top-down shooter where you are alone on an alien planet.
The game is based on Crimsonland, and the graphic after Starcraft, that's why the game is called Crimsoncraft.

There are 2 modes: campaing and endless mode

# 1. Campaign
There are 5 missions available, 5th one ends with the BOSS.

# 2. Endless mode
This mode enables drops from monsters, including new weapons not avaiable in campaign and other bonuses like freezing all enemies or autoturret.
Monsters gives experience points, after leveling up you can chose a perk to permanently upgrade the player.

To open the game locally you need to enable local picture stream in your browser.
You can play the game on this site: https://dante.mangowcy.pl/JS/kati/ccrimsoncraft2/crimsoncraft2.html

-few weapons with different mechanics (shotgun, bazooka, machinegun)
-exp sysrtem with level-up perks
